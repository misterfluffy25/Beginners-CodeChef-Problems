Problem - 

Consider a currency system in which there are notes of six denominations, namely, Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100.
If the sum of Rs. N is input, write a program to computer smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N.

Output
For each test case, display the smallest number of notes that will combine to give N, in a new line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
Example
Input
