PROBLEM - 

Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three angles A, B and C, of the triangle separated by space.

Output
For each test case, display 'YES' if the triangle is valid, and 'NO', if it is not, in a new line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 180
Example
Input

3 
40 40 100
45 45 90
180 1 1
Output

YES
YES
NO

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int side1, side2, side3, sum = 0;
        cin>>side1>>side2>>side3;
        sum = side1 + side2 + side3;
        if(sum == 180){
            cout<<"YES"<<endl;
        }
        else{
            cout<<"NO"<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
